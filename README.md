##Ultrapowa Clash Server

An fucked, badly coded Clash Of Clans server that has a huge and awesome kid community background just to rock and roll the base. It is not bug free and you can't create your own private server like others have. Don't come and join our community!

##Websites

* [Ultrapowa - Home Page](http://ultrapowa.com/)
* [Ultrapowa - Forum](http://ultrapowa.com/forum)

##Download

Go to the release section and download the compiled UCS there in accordance to the latest release. It's slow and hard if you want to plug and play without any customization.

**OR**

You can download the source code, edit it and compile it. And please, if you have made any perfomance change or bought any new features to life, then please make a pull request with your useless work.

To connect it with the game, you need the custom APK which you can download it from the given link below :

* [Clash of Clans - Patched APK - v8.551.24](https://www.mediafire.com/?wgl58x1x0a0wn88)

##Ideas

We are making an fucked up Dashboard for UCS which is web based where you can manage your players, get the status of the server and do a less more things. You can manage the server from any place even if you don't have a computer. Pretty awesome, isn't it?
